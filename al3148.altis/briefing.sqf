				A rebel is one who rises in armed resistance against a government. In this case it would be the police. However, due to the small amount of police compared to the possible amount of rebels, do not attack the police without a reason, please be civil and use common sense, and don't take the word rebel literally, but instead how it will make this server fun for all.<br/><br/>
				1. A rebel must first form a gang, and then declare intentions.<br/>
				2. Resistance does not excuse RDMing (See RDMing in General Rules)<br/>
				3. Resistance roleplay should be conducted in more ways than constantly robbing the bank or shooting police officers.<br/>
				4. Resistance must be coordinated.<br/>
				5. A PROPER reason must be behind each and every attack.<br/><br/>

				1. Being in a gang is not illegal. Only when illegal crimes are committed.<br/>

				3. Gangs may hold and control gang areas. Other gangs may attack a controlling gang to compete for control of a gang area.<br/>
				4. To declare war on another gang, the leader must announce it in global and all gang members of both gangs must be notified. For a more long term gang war, a declaration should be made on the forums.<br/>
				5. Gangs may not kill unarmed civilians, unless said civilian is part of a rival gang and in your gangs controlled area.<br/>
				6. Gangs may not kill civilians, unless they are under threat. Killing unarmed civilians because they do not comply is considered RDM, but you can injure/damage.<br/><br/>
